# SimpleSQL
Implements an expression parser for an SQL like syntax. This is not a complete database. If you want that then use something like SQLite or any of the many other Open Source database packages.
This library is used to add a query style interface to a C++ application to query a selection of objects from a larger set using a user supplied string.

# TODO
- Implement the select clause
- Implement "order by"
